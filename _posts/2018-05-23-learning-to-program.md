Two days ago I saw this hashtag on Twitter titled [#100DaysOfCode](http://www.100daysofcode.com). With a little investigation, I became inspired to take the challenge. It's a public commitment to code for at least one hour everyday for the next 100 days. I know how to write HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. But, I've always wanted to dive into programming&mdash;specifically learning the Ruby language. I'm not exactly sure how I'll use it. But, it looks beautiful. That's important to me. The community around it seems incredible. And, programming offers possibility. I don't know the best way to learn Ruby or programming in general. I'm going to spend an hour each day figuring it out. I want to write beautiful code. I'm inspired to create something with code. I'll use this blog to share my journey.

An appropriate first script to close with...

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
```
